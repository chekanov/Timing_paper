\section{Acceptance vs $\beta$}
\label{appendix}

Figure~\ref{fig:efficiency_beta} shows the reconstruction
acceptance as a function of $c\tau$ and the  particle velocity  $\beta=|p|/E$, for the two extreme
cases of the timing layers.
The calculations were performed using the Monte Carlo simulations for emerging jets (see the text).

Acceptance for the reconstruction of emerging jets using the timing layers with different timing resolutions.
The histogram shows the acceptance as a function of $c\tau$ and the  particle velocity $\beta$.
