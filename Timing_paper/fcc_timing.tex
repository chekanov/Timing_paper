\section{Introduction}

Future particle colliders such as CLIC \cite{Linssen:1425915}, the International Linear Collider (ILC) \cite{Behnke:2013xla}, the high-energy LHC (HE-LHC),
and $pp$ colliders of the European initiative, FCC-hh~\cite{Benedikt:2206376} and the Chinese initiative, SppC~\cite{Tang:2015qga} 
will motivate  high-precision measurements of particles and jets 
at large transverse momenta. 
Timing information in these experiments  can be used to improve particle and jet reconstruction and to suppress backgrounds.
For example, high-precision timing will be beneficial for $b$-tagging for  post-LHC experiments. 
At CLIC and FCC, high-precision time stamping of calorimeter energy deposits will be essential for
background rejection (i.e. fake energy deposits) and pile-up mitigation.
Precise timing information improves reconstruction of particle-flow objects by reducing overlap 
of out-of-time energy showers in highly-granular calorimeters.

Timing layers can be used for detection of long-lived particles and identification of standard model (SM) particles. 
Conceptual design reports for future experiments have not yet fully explored 
the benefits of the time-of-flight (TOF) measurements with calorimeters having tens-of-picosecond resolution.

In this paper we investigate the benefits of timing layers with resolution in the range 10~ps -- 1~ns. 
The resolution of 1~ns is standard for existing and planned calorimeters~\cite{Linssen:1425915,Behnke:2013xla,Benedikt:2206376,Tang:2015qga}, and is used as a benchmark for comparisons with the more challenging 10 -- 20~ps  resolution devices. 
In addition, we investigate the capabilities of timing layers for identification of heavy stable particles which may be produced due to 
 physics beyond the 
standard model (BSM). These studies can help shape the requirements for future calorimeters, which were already 
outlined in the CPAD report~\cite{Ahmed:2019sim} that emphasized the need to develop fast calorimetric readouts.

\section{Proposal}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


A generic design of calorimeters for future collider experiments 
is based on two main characteristics: (1) high-granularity  electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadronic (HCAL) 
calorimeters with cell sizes ranging from $3\times 3$~mm$^2$ to $5\times 5$~cm$^2$.
(2) timing with a nanosecond precision that improves background rejection, vertex association, and detection of new particles. 
According to the CPAD report~\cite{Ahmed:2019sim}, the development of ``picosecond time resolution'' for calorimeters is one 
 of the critical needs. 
Presently,  high-granularity calorimeters with $>1$ million channels and with tens of picosecond resolution represent a 
significant challenge due to the large cost.

As part of the HL-LHC upgrade program, CMS and ATLAS experiments are designing high-precision timing detectors with 
 resolution of about 30~ps~\cite{Collaboration:2623663,FERRI2020162159}. They are based on silicon sensors that add an 
 extra ``time dimension’’ to event reconstruction. 

As mentioned above, such timing capabilities have not been fully explored for detectors beyond the HL-LHC upgrade, such as 
 the ECAL and HCAL of the CLIC/FCC detectors. 
It is considered an expensive option for the many millions of channels of these highly granular detectors. 
This opens an opportunity to investigate a cost-effective ``timing layer'', with time resolution better than 30~ps,  
 to be installed in front of barrel and forward calorimeters.

In this paper we  will investigate the physics advantages of such timing layers in the post-LHC experiments. 
Typically, thin detectors in front of calorimeters are called ``preshower'', and were used in the  ZEUS, CDF, ATLAS and CMS experiments.
Their design goal is to count the number of charged
particles in order to correct for upstream energy losses. The timing information of minimum-ionizing particles (MIP) has 
not been used for particle identifications or event timing. 
Unlike the standard preshower detectors, we propose to not only count MIP signals, but also measure 
 high-precision timing and position of the MIPs.
This timing detector will have a similar granularity as the proposed high-granularity ECALs, 
but will have sensor and readout technology that are best suited for time-stamping of MIP signals.
Our proposal is to enclose the ECALs with two timing layers, one before the first EM layer, and the other after the 
last ECAL layer (but before the first HCAL layer). The two timing layers allow a robust calculation of time stamps by correlating 
 the position and timing of the particles passing through the ECAL.

We explore this idea using a semi-analytical approach and using Monte Carlo simulations. 
A schematic representation of the positions of the timing layers for a generic detector geometry is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_rad}. 
In the following, the first timing layer (closest to the interaction point) will be called TL1, while the second timing layer after the
 ECAL will be called TL2.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{timing_layer.pdf}\hfill
\end{center}
\caption{Example positions of thin timing layers for a generic detector. The timing detectors  enclose the 
electromagnetic calorimeter, allowing  a reliable calculation of the  MIP signals with a timing resolution of the order of 10~ps.}
\label{fig:eff_rad}
\end{figure}

There are several reasons why the second timing layer (TL2) can be useful:

\begin{itemize}

\item
It can be used to measure the TOF between TL2 and TL1 for identification
of stable massive particles without a known production vertex. This is especially important
for BSM models predicting stable heavy particles
decaying close to the surface of the ECAL, or
in the situations when tracks cannot be used to establish the production vertex for neutral heavy particles.
For proton colliders,  the second layer can mitigate situations when the primary vertex position  
is smeared due to large pileup.


For a typical ECAL based on silicon technology, the distance between TL2 and TL1 is  20 -- 40~cm, depending on the calorimeter design.
It is not immediately obvious that such a small distance can be used for physics measurements. 
A particle traveling at the speed of light can cross this distance within $\sim 1$~ns.
As we will discuss later, this distance is sufficient to provide a large acceptance 
for heavy particle identification  assuming  10 -- 20~ps resolution detectors. 

\item
It allows to correlate the hits with the first layer, and thus provide directionality of the hits. This feature can be useful to
match the hits with the calorimeter cells and to deal with back-scatter hits which are typically arriving from the HCAL at a later time. 

\item
It provides redundancy for the calculation of TOF using the distance from the production vertex determined using tracks.

\end{itemize}

The second layer of the timing detector can be justified if the recorded time difference between the first and the last ECAL  
layers of the electromagnetic showers is not significantly different from that expected from a particle traveling with speed of light.
If the travel time is significantly affected by large fluctuations caused by electromagnetic showers,    
the second timing layer cannot be used effectively.

In order to verify this point, we used a full {\sc geant}4 (version 10.3)~\cite{Allison2016186} simulation 
of the SiFCC detector~\cite{Chekanov:2016ppq} that allows the use of the ECAL hit information.
This detector design has an ECAL built from highly segmented silicon-tungsten cells with transverse size $2 \times 2$~cm$^2$.
The ECAL has 30 layers of tungsten pads with silicon readout,
corresponding to 35~X$_{0}$. The first 20 layers use tungsten of 3~mm thickness, while the last ten layers use tungsten layers of
twice the thickness, and thus have half the  sampling fraction.  
The distance between the centers of the first and last ECAL layers is about 24~cm.  

To verify that the time differences between the last and the first ECAL layer is close to the time
required for a particle that travels with speed of light, and can be neglected for timing layers of 1~ns resolution,
  two samples of single pions ($\pi^\pm$) with momenta of 1 and 10~GeV respectively were created. The
 pseudorapidity ($\eta$) for all pions was fixed at $\eta=0$ (central region). 
The particles were reconstructed in the ECAL, and the time difference $\Delta T= T_{\mathrm{last}}-T_{\mathrm{first}}$ of the hits 
 between the last and first ECAL layers was calculated.
Only the hits arriving first in time were considered since the electronics typically register\footnote{The Monte Carlo studies in
 this paper do not include a simulation of calorimeter electronics.} the fastest hits, while slower hits can be saved in pipeline buffers.

Figure~\ref{fig:timediff} shows the time distribution of the earliest hits 
for 1 and 10~GeV pions. It can be seen that the peak positions of the distributions are closer 
than 1~ns, as expected for the distance of 24~cm between the last and first ECAL layers.
Therefore, the hits registered by TL1 and TL2 will be considered simultaneous for the
standard 1~ns resolution readout. They will be fully correlated in time, and will be identified as a single crossing particle.

If the resolution of the timing layer is of the order of 10 -- 20~ps, a physics measurement of TOF would be possible.
To check this, 
Fig.~\ref{fig:timediff} shows the hit time distribution for (anti) deuterons, denoted as $d^{\pm}$. 
The distributions are significantly different from the $\pi^{\pm}$ case. According to the simulation, the 1~GeV
(anti) deuterons should be measured with the time delay of 0.7 -- 1.4~ns between the last and first layers.
The value of 0.7~ns was estimated from the peak of the Landau distribution used to fit the $d^{\pm}$ 
curve presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:timediff}(a),
while 1.4~ns was obtained from the mean of this distribution. Even for the most conservative 0.7~ns value, this indicates 
 that 1~GeV deuterons can be separated from pions that have 0.5~ns time difference. Such a separation can be observed 
 using a tens-of-picosecond detector.
 For the 10~GeV particles shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:timediff}(b), no separation between $d^{\pm}$ and $\pi^{\pm}$ can be observed.

In summary, we have illustrated that a typical difference between TL2 and TL1 (which is approximated by the difference
between the last and first ECAL layer) is sufficient for particle identification using the TOF.
As an example, a $d^{\pm}$ can be identified and separated from pions for momentum less than 1~GeV.
This means that  particles heavier than deuterons should be identifiable for a momentum larger than 1~GeV.
In the following, we will abstract from the {\sc geant}4 simulations and calculate the kinematic regions  where the 
 identification of heavy stable  particles using timing layers is possible.

\section{Summary}

This paper discusses the benefits of timing layers positioned in front of the hadronic calorimeters.
Using the full {\sc geant}4 simulation and a semi-analytic approach,
the figures of merit for the identification of single particles
using timing layers with resolutions of 10~ps -- 1~ns were calculated.
It was illustrated 
how such layers can be used for single-particle identification and
discrimination of heavy long-lived particles in the context of the dark QCD model.
It was shown that the timing layers lead to a significant benefit for reconstruction of heavy long-lived particles 
in the range of $c\tau$ and momentum where track-based measurements have low acceptance.
