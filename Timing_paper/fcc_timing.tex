\section{Introduction}

Future experiments, such as CLIC \cite{Linssen:1425915}, International Linear Collider (ILC) \cite{Behnke:2013xla}, high-energy LHC (HE-LHC),
future circular $pp$ colliders of the European initiative, FCC-hh~\cite{Benedikt:2206376} and the Chinese initiative, SppC~\cite{Tang:2015qga} will require high precision measurements of particle and jets 
at large transverse momenta. 
The usage of timing information for such experiments  can  provide additional 
information that can be used to improve particle and jet reconstruction, as well as to deal with background events.
At this moment, conceptional design reports for these experiments did not fully explore
the benefits of the time of flight (TOF) measurements with tens-of-picosecond resolutions.

\section{Proposal}

A generic design of hadronic (electromagnetic) calorimeters for future particle collision experiments (HE-LHC, FCC, CLIC, ILC etc.) 
is based on two main characteristics: (1) high-granularity calorimeters with cells ranged from $3\times 3$ mm$^2$ (for ECAL) to $5\times 5$ cm$^2$  (for HCAL) in sizes.
(2) timing with nanosecond precision that improves background rejection, vertex association, and detection of new particles. 
According to the CPAD report \cite{Ahmed:2019sim}, a development of “picosecond time resolution” for future calorimeters is one of the critical needs. 
Presently. high-granularity calorimeters (with >1 millions channels) with tens of picoseconds resolution represent a 
significant challenge due the large cost.

As a part of the HL-LHC upgrade program, CMS and ATLAS experiments are designing high-precision timing detectors with the time resolution of about 30 ps. 
They are based on silicon sensors that add an extra ``dimension’’ to event reconstruction. 
Such timing capabilities are not fully explored for future detectors beyond the HL-LHC upgrade. 
High-precision timing will be beneficial for new physics searches and b-tagging for all post-LHC experiments. 
For CLIC and FCC, high-precision time stamping will be essential for background rejection and pile-up mitigation. 

Currently, the baseline designs of the high-granularity ECAL and HCAL of the CLIC/FCC detectors have not been 
optimized for precision timing in the range of a few tens of picoseconds. 
The latter is considered as an expensive option for many mullions of channels of these high-granularity detectors. 
This opens an opportunity to investigate a cost-effective “timing layer” (with the time resolution of smaller than 30~ps) for the post-LHC detectors. 
This layer will be installed on front of high-granularity calorimeters, covering both the forward and barrel regions.

In this paper we  will investigate physics advantages for timing layers in the front of calorimeters  
of the post-LHC experiments. 
Typically, thin detectors on front of calorimeters are called ``preshower''. The design goal of such detectors is to count the number of charged
particles in oder to correct for energy loses. The timing information of ``mips'' ( minimum–ionising particles) is not used for particle identifications. 
Unlike the standard pre-shower detector, we propose not only count mips, but also reconstruct high-precision timing and the position.
This timing detector will have a similar granularity as the proposed high-granularity EM calorimeters themselves, 
but will have a sensor technology and readout which is best suited for mip time stamping (not necessarily for energy reconstruction). 
Our proposal is to enclose the EM detectors with two timing layers, one - before the first EM layer, and the second is after the last EM layer (but before
the HCAL). The two layers of the timing detector allows a robust identification of time by correlating the position and timestamps of the particle passing through
the ECAL.

In this paper we will explore this idea using full Monte Carlo simulations. 
A schematic representation of the positions of the timing layers for a generic detector geometry is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_rad}

   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{timing_layer.pdf}\hfill

\caption{An example of positions of the thin timing layers for a generic detector. The thin timing layers  will enclose the electromagnetic calorimeter, allow a reliable reconstruction of the  mip signals with a timing resolution of the order of 10~ps.}
\label{fig:eff_rad}
\end{figure}


The second layer of the timing detector can be justified if fluctuations of hits times are smaller than  the resolution 
of the timing layers. In oder to verify this, we used a full Geant4 (version 10.3)~\cite{Allison2016186} simulation 
of the SiFCC detector \cite{Chekanov:2016ppq} that allows to use the information on hits from the ECAL.
The ECAL is built from a highly segmented silicon-tungsten  with the transverse cell size of $2 \times 2$~cm.
The ECAL has 30 layers built from tungsten pads with silicon readout,
corresponding to 35~X$_{0}$. The first 20 layers use tungsten of 3~mm thickness.
The last ten layers use tungsten layers of
twice the thickness, and thus have half the  sampling fraction.  

To verify that the time differences between last and first layer of ECAL is sufficiently small, and can be neglected for the timing layers that
have a timing resolution of the order of 10~ns, a sample of single pions was created with 1 and 10~GeV momenta. 
The particles were reconstructed in the ECAL calorimeter,
and the time difference $\Delta T= T_{\mathrm{last}}-T_{\mathrm{first}}$ of the hits between the last and first ECAL layers was calculated.
Only hits that arrive first were considered.
Figure~\ref{fig:timediff} shows the time distribution for 1 and 10 GeV pions. It can be seen that the peak positions of the distributions are smaller
than 1~ps, as expected for the distance of about 20~cm between  the last and first layers\footnote{The precision with which the simulations were performed are about 0.2-0.3~ns}. More importantly, the RMS of these distributions are significantly smaller than the 10~ns. 
Therefore, for the timing layers that have a resolution of the order of 10-20~ns, a single particle crossing the two layers  will be seen a single simultaneous hit,
thus such hits can be well correlated in time and identified as a single crossing particle.
