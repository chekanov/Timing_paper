\section{Introduction}

Future experiments, such as CLIC \cite{Linssen:1425915}, International Linear Collider (ILC) \cite{Behnke:2013xla}, high-energy LHC (HE-LHC),
future circular $pp$ colliders of the European initiative, FCC-hh~\cite{Benedikt:2206376} and the Chinese initiative, SppC~\cite{Tang:2015qga} will require high precision measurements of particle and jets 
at large transverse momenta. 
The usage of timing information for such experiments  can  provide additional 
information that can be used to improve particle and jet reconstruction, as well as to deal with background events.
At this moment, conceptional design reports for these experiments did not fully explore
the benefits of the time of flight (TOF) measurements with tens-of-picosecond resolutions.

\section{Proposal}

A generic design of hadronic (electromagnetic) calorimeters for future particle collision experiments (HE-LHC, FCC, CLIC, ILC etc.) 
is based on two main characteristics: (1) high-granularity calorimeters with cells ranged from $3\times 3$ mm$^2$ (for ECAL) to $5\times 5$ cm$^2$  (for HCAL) in sizes.
(2) timing with nanosecond precision that improves background rejection, vertex association, and detection of new particles. 
According to the CPAD report \cite{Ahmed:2019sim}, a development of “picosecond time resolution” for future calorimeters is one of the critical needs. 
Presently. high-granularity calorimeters (with >1 millions channels) with tens of picoseconds resolution represent a 
significant challenge due the large cost.

As a part of the HL-LHC upgrade program, CMS and ATLAS experiments are designing high-precision timing detectors with the time resolution of about 30 ps. 
They are based on silicon sensors that add an extra ``dimension’’ to event reconstruction. 
Such timing capabilities are not fully explored for future detectors beyond the HL-LHC upgrade. 
High-precision timing will be beneficial for new physics searches and b-tagging for all post-LHC experiments. 
For CLIC and FCC, high-precision time stamping will be essential for background rejection and pile-up mitigation. 

Currently, the baseline designs of the high-granularity ECAL and HCAL of the CLIC/FCC detectors have not been 
optimized for precision timing in the range of a few tens of picoseconds. 
The latter is considered as an expensive option for many mullions of channels of these high-granularity detectors. 
This opens an opportunity to investigate a cost-effective “timing layer” (with the time resolution of smaller than 30 ps) for the post-LHC detectors. 
This layer will be installed on front of high-granularity calorimeters, covering both the forward and barrel regions.

In this paper we  will investigate physics advantages for timing layers in the front of calorimeters (sometime termed “pre-shower detector”) 
of the post-LHC experiments. This timing detector will have a similar granularity as the proposed high-granularity EM calorimeters themselves, 
but will have a sensor technology and readout which is best suited for mip time stamping (not necessarily for energy reconstruction). 
Our proposal is to enclose the EM detectors with two timing layers, one - before the first EM layer, and the second is after the last EM layer (but before
the HCAL). In this paper we will explore this idea using full Monte Carlo simulations.

\section{Single particles} 


Before considering the full Geant4 simulation, let us discuss the benefit of the TOF information 
for identification of separate particles. Fig.~\ref{fig:singleparticles} shows the $3\sigma$ separation from the pion
mass hypothesis using the same technique as discussed  in \cite{Cerri:2018rkm}. The lines are calculated
using the following consideration: ADD TEXT
